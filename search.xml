<blockquote>
<p>All I wanted was to try and realize whatever was in me. Why was that so difficult?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When poets write novels they are apt to behave as if<br>they were gods, with the power to look beyond and comprehend any human story and serve it up as if the<br>Almighty himself, omnipresent, were relating it in all<br>its naked truth. That I am no more able to do than the<br>poets. But my story is more important to me than any<br>poet’s story to him, for it is my own.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet each one represents an attempt<br>on the part of nature to create a human being. We<br>enjoy a common origin in our mothers; we all come<br>from the same pit. But each individual, who is himself<br>an experimental throw from the depths, strives towards<br>his own goal. We can understand each other; but each<br>person is able to interpret himself to himself alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>My story is not a pleasant one; it is neither sweet nor harmonious, as invented stories are; it has the taste of nonsense and chaos, of madness and dreams — like the lives of all men who stop deceiving themselves.</p>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Through it ran straight lines and paths that led into the future; here were duty and guilt, bad conscience and confessions, forgiveness and good resolutions, love and reverence, wisdom and Bible readings. In this world, you had to conduct yourself so that life should be pure, unsullied, beautiful, and well-ordered.</p>
<p>The other world, however, also began in the middle of our own house and was completely different; it smelt different, spoke a different language, and made different claims and promises. This second world was peopled with servant girls and workmen, ghost stories and scandalous rumors, a gay tide of monstrous, intriguing, frightful, mysterious things; it included the slaughterhouse and the prison, drunken and scolding women […]</p>

<ol start="6">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Doubtless, I was part of the world of light and righteousness as the child of my parents, but wherever I listened or directed my gaze, I found the other thing, and I lived half in the other world, although it was often strangely alien to me and I inevitably suffered from panic and a bad conscience.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>There was always the return to their father and the path of righteousness that was so fine and redeeming that I felt convinced that this alone was the right, good, worthy thing; and yet I found the part of the story which was played among the wicked and lost souls far more alluring.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] an atmosphere of homeliness and affection hung about all these things; my heart warmed to them gratefully as that of the Prodigal Son must have done when confronted with the sight and smell of the old familiar rooms of his house. But none of this was mine any longer; it all belonged to the world of my parents, and I was deeply and guiltily engulfed in the alien tide.</p>
<p>[…] the voices of my elder sisters coming from the living room wereall more moving and precious than ever, but it had ceased to be a comfort and something I could rely on and had become a kind of reproach. This was no longer my world; I could have no part in its cheerfulness and peace. My feet were defiled; I could not wipe them on the mat; I was accompanied by shadows of which this world of home knew nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The real inner line of our fate consists of these experiences hidden from other people. A gash or wound of this kind grows together again; it is healed and forgotten, but in the inner recesses of our minds, it lives on and bleeds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Demian said] “Here was a man with something in his face that frightened other people. They did not dare lay hands on him; he impressed them, he and his children. It is virtually certain that he bore no actual mark on his brow like a postmark! Real life isn’t as crude as that. Rather, there was some hardly perceptible mark, a little more intelligence and self-possession in his eyes than people were accustomed to. This man had power, and they all went in awe of him; he had a ‘sign.’ You can explain how you will. People always want whatever is comfortable and puts them in the right.</p>
<p>[…] It was a sinister thing that a breed of strange, fearless people should be going about, so they attached a nickname and a myth to this family to take revenge and rid themselves of guilt for all the fear they had experienced.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="11">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I realize that many people cannot credit a child not yet eleven years old with such feelings, but this story is not intended for them. I am recounting it to those who have a better understanding of human nature.</p>
<p>The grown-up who has learned to translate a part of his feelings into thoughts misses these thoughts in the child and therefore finally denies even the experiences themselves.</p>
<p>But I have rarely felt and suffered more deeply than at that time.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="12">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Demian said] “When you are afraid of someone it means you have provided that someone with some kind of lever. You have done something wrong for example and the other person knows this and by this means has acquired a hold over you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="13">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>And something occurred to me over which I had often pondered, that a confession…to my parents would merely relieve me without entirely redeeming me. Now I had almost confessed to some one else, a stranger, and a feeling of relief rushed at me like a strong perfume.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="14">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>And today, I understand why I tried so hard to forget my savior. I was using all the strength of my wounded soul to flee from the infernal abyss, to escape the dreadful servitude to Kromer, and to return to the place of former happiness and contentment… to return to the piety of Abel.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="15">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The inner, however, was that I had escaped from Kromer’s and the Devil’s hand but not through any power and effort of my own. I had tried to tread the paths of the world and they had been too slippery for me. Now, as the grip of a friendly hand had saved me, I retreated to my mother’s lap and the security of a pious and hedged-in childhood without as much as a glance at the world outside.</p>
<p>[…] In the blindness of my heart, I chose to be dependent on my father and mother, on all the familiar and much cherished ‘world of light.’ I already knew that it was not the only one.</p>

<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>My conscious self lived in the homely and sanctioned, my conscious self denied the new world that was darkling round me. Side by side with this, however, I lived in dreams, actions, desires of a subterranean kind over which my conscious life nervously constructed a series of bridges, for my childhood’s world was falling apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="17">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Like almost all parents, mine made no attempt to foster the stirring roots of life; no reference was made to them. All they did was to go to endless trouble to bolster my hopeless attempts to deny reality and continue to dwell in a child’s world which was becoming more and more unreal and false.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="18">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw Demian’s face and remarked that it was not a boy’s face but a man’s and then I saw, or rather became aware, that it was not really the face of a man either; it had something different about it, almost a feminine element. And for the time being his face seemed neither masculine nor childish, neither old nor young but a hundred years old, almost timeless and bearing the mark of other periods of history than our own. Animals might look thus, trees or stars. I did not know then, of course, I did not feel exactly what I am writing about it now, as an adult, but it was something of the kind. Perhaps he was handsome, perhaps I found him attractive, perhaps he repelled me too, I could not even be sure of that. All I saw was that he was different from the rest of us, that he was like an animal, a spirit or an image.</p>
<p>[Demian said] “The point is that this God of both the Old and ‘New Testaments is a wonderful figure but not what he purports to represent. He is all that is good, noble, he is the fatherly, the beautiful, the most high, the sentimental-all right! But the world consists also of other things which are merely ascribed to the Devil. And that half-section of the world is suppressed; it is never mentioned.</p>
<p>I have no objection to people honouring this God Jehovah, far from it. But I consider that we should sanctify and honour everything, the whole world, not merely this artificially separated, official half!</p>
<p>Therefore, alongside the divine service should be a Devil’s service; that, in my view, would be right and proper. Otherwise, you must create a God for yourself who embraces the Devil in himself and before whom you don’t have to drop your eyes in shame when the most natural things in the world take place.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="19">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Demian said] “I see that you have thoughts you are unable to express. H that is so you must know that you too have not lived so far according to your own conception of life, and that is not a good thing. Only the ideas that we really live have any value.</p>
<p>You have known that your ‘permitted’ world was only half of the world and you have tried to subjugate the second half after the manner of the priests and teachers. It will not be to your benefit. It benefits no one once he has begun to think.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="20">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Demian said] “Therefore each one of us must discover for himself what is permitted and what is forbidden as far as he himself is concerned.</p>
<p>Whoever is too complacent to think for himself and be his own judge manages to accommodate himself to the ‘shalt nots’ as they exist at the present time. It is easy for him.</p>
<p>But there are others who are conscious of the commandments in themselves; things are forbidden to them which every man does every day of his life, and other things are permitted to them which are otherwise prohibited. Every man must stand alone.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="21">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>It was not into the church that I was ready to be received but into something of an entirely different nature, an order of thought and personality which I felt must exist somewhere on earth […].</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="22">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>My eyes were fixed on that pale, stone mask, spellbound, and I felt that here was the real Demian! What he had been before when he had gone around and chatted with me was only half of him, a person who for a time was playing a part, adapting himself to it, joining in the game to oblige me. The real Demian, however, looked like this — stone, age-old, animal-like, stone-like, handsome, cold, dead and yet with an alarming secret life within. And round him hung this aura of quiet emptiness, this ether and celestial space, this lonely death!</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="23">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A sense of disillusionment vitiated and blunted my normal feelings and pleasures, the garden had lost its fragrance, the forest its magic, the world stood round me like a clearance sale of old rubbish, insipid and with all its charm gone; books were so much paper, music was a noise.</p>
<p>[…] it is subjected to sun or frost and life slowly retreats. It does not die. It waits.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Chapter-4-Beatrice"><a href="#Chapter-4-Beatrice" class="headerlink" title="[Chapter] 4: Beatrice"></a>[Chapter] 4: Beatrice</h2><ol start="24">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>My boyish charm had vanished, I even felt that it was impossible for anyone to love me and I was out of love with myself. I often felt a great longing for Demian; but no less often I hated him, holding him responsible for the impoverishment of my life which I was dragging round with me like a foul disease.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="25">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet in spite of it all, I almost revelled in my torment. So long had I crawled along, blind and foolish, for so long it had my heart cowered as it were silent and anemic in a corner, that even this self-reproach, this loathsome feeling was welcome. At least it was emotion of some kind; fire was kindled and my heart raced. Though utterly routed, I felt something akin to release and the dawn of spring in the midst of my trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="26">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many ways in which providence can make us feel lonely and lead us back to ourselves.</p>
<p>It was like a bad dream; I see myself as a dreamer, spellbound, restless and tormented, dragging my odious and unclean way over mud and mire, broken beer glasses and nights filled with cynical chatter. There is the kind of dream in which on your way to the princess you get stuck in quagmires, back lanes full of refuse and foul odours. That was how it was with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="27">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>But now I hadan object for my love, someone to look up to. Once again, I had an ideal; life once more was full of mystery, gaiety, and mysterious twilight, and I felt at ease again and at home, even if only as the servant and slave of an honored image.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="28">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The outlines of the face were blurred, but the eyes, edged with pink, the brightness of the forehead, and the energetic red mouth glowed excitingly from the surface. I sat opposite it for a long time even after the picture had faded.</p>
<p>And gradually a feeling came over me that it was neither Beatrice nor Demian but myself. Not that the picture was like me — I did not feel it should be — but the face somehow expressed my life; it was my inner self, fate, or daimon.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="29">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Fate and temperament are the names of a concept.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="30">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I frequently met the girl I called Beatrice, but these encounters did not move me anymore; I was merely aware of an uninterrupted harmony and a sympathetic longing that said: you are bound up with me, not you but your image; you are part of my fate.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="31">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Demian said] “There’s certainly a pleasant element in it — the carouse, Bacchanalian revels! But that is just what the majority of people who spend a lot of time in pubs miss.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Chapter-5-The-Bird-Fights-Its-Way-Out-of-the-Egg"><a href="#Chapter-5-The-Bird-Fights-Its-Way-Out-of-the-Egg" class="headerlink" title="[Chapter] 5: The Bird Fights Its Way Out of the Egg"></a>[Chapter] 5: The Bird Fights Its Way Out of the Egg</h2><ol start="32">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>“The egg is the world. Whoever wants to be born must first destroy a world. The bird is flying to God. The name of the God is called Abraxas.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="33">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] we see the boundaries between ourselves and nature quiver and dissolve. Webecome acquainted with the state of mind when we are unable to decide whether the lineaments of our body result from impressions received from outside or from within us.</p>
<p>In no other practice is it so simple to discover how creative we are and to what extent our souls participate in the continuous creation of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="34">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Pistorius said] “We always set too narrow limits on our personalities. We count as ours merely what we experience: differently as individuals or recognize as being divergent. Yet we consist of the whole existence of the world, each of us, and just as our body bears in it the various stages of our evolution back to the fish and further back still, we have in our soul everything that has ever existed in the human mind.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="35">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Pistorius said] “But he knows nothing of it! While he remains ignorant, he is a tree or a stone, at best, an animal. Once, however, he has the first glimmering of this knowledge, he becomes a man.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="36">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Pistorius said] “And look! You discover the miracle that you are gradually winning the mastery and that to the great common power that sweeps you upward is added a fine, subtle power, a machine, a means of steering a course. And it’s wonderful. Without it you would drift about in the air, powerless. That is what madmen do. They have deeper presentiments than the people on the pavement, but they have no key and no helm to steer with, and they whirl round in the abyss.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Chapter-6-Jacob-Wrestling"><a href="#Chapter-6-Jacob-Wrestling" class="headerlink" title="[Chapter] 6: Jacob Wrestling"></a>[Chapter] 6: Jacob Wrestling</h2><ol start="37">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Pistorius said] “You shouldn’t make comparisons between yourself and other people; if nature created you a bat, you must not try to make yourself into an ostrich. You often consider yourself a special case; you propose following the majority’s different ways. That you must unlearn.</p>
<p>Look into the fire. gaze into the clouds, and as soon as the presentiments come to you and the voices within you begin to speak, surrender to them. Do not merely ask whether what you are doing suits your teacher or your father or this or that good god! That’s the way to self-destruction. That would be the pedestrian way, becoming a fossil.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="38">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Pistorius said] “The person you wish to murder is never Mr. So and So. He is only a disguise. When we hate someone we hate something within ourselves, in his image. We are never stirred up by something which does not already exist within us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="39">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>“The things we see,” said Pistorius gently, “are the things which are already in us. There is no reality beyond what we have inside us. That is why most people live unrealistically; they take pictures outside themselves for the real ones and fail to express their own world. One can, of course, live contentedly enough in that situation. But once you know about the other you no longer have the choice of following the majority way. The way of the majority, Sinclair, is easy, ours is hard … But now we must go.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="40">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I found it impossible to proffer him any advice that did not emanate from my own personal experience unless I felt able to follow it myself. I was silent and felt humiliated that someone should ask for advice when I had none to give.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="41">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>He had never heard me speak like that before and I immediately realized with a mixture of shame and horror that the arrow which I had fired at him and with which I had pierced his heart, had come from his own armory — and that I was now returning to him with sharpened barbs the self-reproaches which I had sometimes heard him utter in his ironical way.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="42">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>And suddenly I realized very forcibly that what Pistorius had been and had given to me was precisely what he could never be and give to himself. He had shown me a way which even he, the leader, must bypass and abandon.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="43">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When I had hit out, I thought I was aiming my blow at a tough, well-armed man, but now it turned out to be a quiet, suffering, defenseless creature who was surrendering without a protest.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="44">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I was not there to write poetry, preach, or paint; neither I nor any other man was there for that purpose. They were only incidental things. There was only one true vocation for everybody-to find the way to himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="45">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>His affair was to discover his own destiny, not something of his own choosing, and live it out wholly and resolutely within himself. Anything else was merely a half-life, an attempt at evasion, an escape into the ideals of the masses, complacency, and fear of his inner soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Chapter-7-Eva"><a href="#Chapter-7-Eva" class="headerlink" title="[Chapter] 7: Eva"></a>[Chapter] 7: Eva</h2><ol start="46">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I found everything disappointing. The course of lectures on the history of philosophy which I attended was as uninspired and stereotyped as the activities of the undergraduates. They were all so much to pattern; everybody behaved in an identical way, and the animated gaiety on their boyish face looked empty and artificial.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="47">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Demian said] “These men who come together in this nervous fashion are riddled with fear and evil; none of them trust each other. They cling to no longer existing ideals and stone anyone who sets up a new one.</p>
<p>Whether the workers murder the manufacturers or the Russians and Germans shoot each other, it will merely be a change of ownership.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="48">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Here and there noisy students were reeling home through the town. I had often marked the contrast between their comic kind of merriment and my solitary life, sometimes with scorn, sometimes with a feeling of deprivation. But never until today had I realized with calm and quiet confidence how little it mattered to me and how remote and dead all that world now was for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="49">
<li></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I called to mind the civil servants in my own town, worthy old gentlemen who clung to the memories of their drunken university days as if they were memories of a blessed paradise, and upon the vanished ‘freedom’ of their student years built a cult similar to that which poets or other ‘Romantics’ formerly devoted to childhood. Was it everywhere alike? It was always somewhere in the past that they looked for ‘freedom’ and ‘happiness’ out of sheer dread lest they should be reminded of their own responsibilities and their own future course.</p>
<p>They drank and made merry for a few years; then they crawled into their shells and became serious-minded men in the service of the state.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>（本篇從大一時寫得 Medium 轉移過來）<br>目前是外文系大一，趁還算記憶猶新的時候，簡單分享一些當時二階過程。同時整理了歷年考題，希望可以減低有意申請者前期搜尋資料的時間成本，並更對症下藥的準備。特別留意的是二階測驗形式的改變。以往是考聽、寫、說三部分，但 111 年起不再考聽力測驗，口說測驗則新增替文章摘要、分析的環節。</p>
<p>本篇分成 3 個部分：</p>

<li><strong>寫作</strong></li>

<p>跟學測作文不太一樣的是，寫作測驗通常是論說文體。一小時的時間，寫作字數建議達 300~400 字。文章架構把握傳統五段式的原則即可( Introduction, Main Points*3, Conclusion )。</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-口試（5-分鐘）"><a href="#Part-2-口試（5-分鐘）" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 口試（5 分鐘）"></a>Part 2. 口試（5 分鐘）</h2><p>之所以為 「口試」 而非 「面試」 ，是因為台大外文的二階著重測驗 「口說能力」 ，而非 「成長經驗」 或 「個人成就」 。有傳言說教授們認為書審越豐富，可能與家世較好有關。既然在書審階段已經給學生展現自己成就的機會，為縮短城鄉、貧富學生的差距，二階單純測試英語口說實力。我不確定這個傳言的真偽，畢竟英語口語能力在某種程度上也難和家庭背景脫鉤。不過如果事實真如傳言所說，那教授們倒也立意良善 — — 不過這都是後話了，總歸一句：教授在二階面試不會詢問書審中與個人經驗相關的問題，也不會要求你自我介紹。（ 但基本題如 「就讀動機」 還是會問。因為雖然書審提過就讀動機了，但書審評分者跟面試教授高機率不是同一批人。 ）</p>
<p>面試分成兩部分：文章摘要與提問、生活對話。每個人的面試時長為 5 分鐘。在輪到我的前 10 分鐘，拿到一張 A4 大小的英文文章。</p>
<h3 id="基礎會話-部分傳統面試問題"><a href="#基礎會話-部分傳統面試問題" class="headerlink" title="基礎會話+部分傳統面試問題"></a>基礎會話+部分傳統面試問題</h3><p>以下結合了我自己和身邊朋友被問到的問題，把面試問題分成 3 部分。根據我先前查找他人經驗分享，和我實際被問到的問題來看，以下都是出題機率非常高的題目，建議好好準備這些最基本的拿分題。同時也提醒，畢竟大家被問到的問題大同小異，多加思考回答如何做出差異化還蠻重要的。</p>
<p><strong>1. 生活會話類</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How did you get here today?</li>
<li>How is the food on campus?</li>
<li>What did you have for lunch?</li>
<li>How is the weather when you get here?</li>
<li>How do you feel right now?</li>
<li>How do you feel about the building of the College of Liberal Arts?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. 文學相關</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What’s your favorite genre of literature?</li>
<li>What’s your favorite book?</li>
<li>What’s your favorite movie?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. 外文系本身、未來規劃</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What courses are you particularly interested in within our department?（了解科系在學什麼很重要，理論上書審階段就要有所了解了。）</li>
<li>What do you aspire to do in the future? （也有人被問到時間軸更具體的：What do you envision yourself doing five years after graduating from college?）</li>
<li>Which other departments did you apply to?（順道一提，台大有一個獨立於大考中心的志願排序系統，會要求你針對台大一階通過科系進行志願排序，以利後續台大內部分發 — — 也就是盡量把人才留在台大的概念。不過教授端是看不到你的校內志願序的。）</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="文章摘要-提問"><a href="#文章摘要-提問" class="headerlink" title="文章摘要+提問"></a>文章摘要+提問</h3><p>在簡單的問候、基礎生活問答之後，教授要求我為 10 分多鐘前拿到的文章做 30 秒摘要。接下來教授依據文章內容提出 2、3 個問題，確認我對文章的理解度。而後的文章延伸問題面向我個人，比如同不同意文中某些觀點。</p>
<p><strong>一些出現過的主題 (+follow-up question)</strong></p>
<p>文章不是文學作品，比較像是長春藤裡面的介紹性質短文。文章載於 A4 大小的單面紙，字數約莫 400 字。內容不算長，但閱讀完文章後，還要花時間想一下怎麼架構 summary 的三個 main points，最後再簡單順過一遍內容。10 分鐘的時間，要好好分配。面試前如果每天找幾篇文章練習做摘要應是不無小補。</p>
<ul>
<li>Discriminatory Language in Roald Dahl’s Children’s Book ( Your perspective on children’s literature? )</li>
<li>Why Do Patients Find It Challenging to Lose Weight ( Your perspective on nostalgia culture? &#x2F; Does social media have a negative impact on how people perceive their own appearance? )</li>
<li>Social Allergy ( Have you ever had a similar experience with your relatives? )</li>
<li>The Difference Between Chinese and Vietnamese Zodiac Signs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-3-應試技巧"><a href="#Part-3-應試技巧" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. 應試技巧"></a>Part 3. 應試技巧</h2><h3 id="借題發揮"><a href="#借題發揮" class="headerlink" title="借題發揮"></a>借題發揮</h3><p>當時我抽到的題目在分析個性如何影響交友模式，包括最基本的 extroverts, introverts 之分，和 narcissistic personality 等等。教授的其一 follow-up question 是在問我的個性和交友模式可以用文中的任一例子解釋嗎？在回答完這個問題後，我順勢提及文學做為一種隱喻，如何形塑我的個性。我談到一個 Trends in Cognitive Sciences 的報告，解釋我如何透過閱讀文學作品了解角色內心世界並與之共鳴，培養同理心、提升社交技能。即便是在問文章問題環節，也可以留心回扣申請外文系的動機。如前所述，5 分鐘裡會花不少時間在與自身無關的問題，不一定有足夠時間讓你完整論述就讀動機。（雖然我不知道評分的 criteria，但能表現足夠動機終究是有益無害。）</p>
<h3 id="改寫現實"><a href="#改寫現實" class="headerlink" title="改寫現實"></a>改寫現實</h3><p>即便做好萬全的準備，口試現場還是可能遇到意料之外的情況。當時在我前面序位進去的應試者，似乎很成功的逗樂了教授們，笑聲從門扉中傳出。在此之前，我聽到的外文系口試經驗，也都是教授很友善、進去聊聊天就好。輪到我時，雖然一位外國教授掛著友好的微笑，但另外兩位臺灣教授全程面無表情，其中一位甚至不和我進行 eye contact。另一個小插曲是我在第一題就失誤，本來想講某個詞，結果說出口時卻是另一個錯誤的字眼。</p>
<p>心理學上有一個概念叫 「認知重估」 (cognitive reappraisal)，簡而言之就是自發的改變對一件事的看法。認知重估的前題是，驅動我們的情緒的並不是實際發生的事件，而是我們看待這些事件的方式。大部分情況中，我們無法得知他人行為背後的動機（ 「教授會臭臉是因為覺得我在第一題就犯下了荒唐的錯誤嗎？」 ），因此不如選擇對自己最有利的解讀方式，編造一套故事，讓自己心情平穩些（ 「大概是因為我的口試序位排在後面，教授經過一整天的面試已經很累了！也有可能兩個教授是黑臉。」 ）</p>
<p>乍聽之下，這種自我欺騙、在心中改寫現實的方法不怎麼管用 — — 畢竟事情發生就是發生了，怎麼可能騙得了自己？但事實上，人的大腦還蠻擅長自我欺騙的。哈佛醫學院的一個研究中，指出安慰劑效應之所以有效，不一定是因為服藥者被欺瞞。研究結果顯示，即便人們清楚知道自己服用的是安慰劑，療效依然顯著。</p>
<p>假如面試中的突發事件，影響了你的心理狀態，可以嘗試改寫現實的小技巧。想像一個情節（在面試的情境中，也許是替教授的面無表情找藉口。）引導自己回到最有利的心理狀態。</p>

    <title>台大外文系：二階經驗 + 筆試、口試考古題</title>
    <url>/2024/08/04/%E3%80%90113-%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%B3%E8%AB%8B%E6%87%B6%E4%BA%BA%E5%8C%85%E3%80%91%E5%8F%B0%E5%A4%A7%E5%A4%96%E6%96%87%E7%B3%BB%EF%BC%9A%E4%BA%8C%E9%9A%8E%E7%B6%93%E9%A9%97-%E7%AD%86%E8%A9%A6%E3%80%81%E5%8F%A3%E8%A9%A6%E8%80%83%E5%8F%A4%E9%A1%8C/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>（本篇從大一時寫得 Medium 轉移過來）<br>目前是外文系大一，趁還算記憶猶新的時候，簡單分享一些當時二階過程。同時整理了歷年考題，希望可以減低有意申請者前期搜尋資料的時間成本，並更對症下藥的準備。特別留意的是二階測驗形式的改變。以往是考聽、寫、說三部分，但 111 年起不再考聽力測驗，口說測驗則新增替文章摘要、分析的環節。</p>
